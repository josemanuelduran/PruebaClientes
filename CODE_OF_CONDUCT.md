# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the PruebaClientes project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting
issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of NurseAide's channels (GitHub, Jira, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to
personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to
the NurseAide project to do the same.

If any member violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the NurseAide project may take
action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email to
[Jose Manuel Dur√°n](mailto:josemanuelduran@gmail.com).
